# Sentiment Analysis using Flask Framework and IBM Natural Language Processing Libraries

This project is a Sentiment Analysis application built using Python's Flask framework and IBM Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. It aims to analyze the sentiment of textual data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or any other text inputs, and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Flask framework installed (`pip install flask`)
- IBM Watson Developer Cloud Python SDK installed (`pip install ibm-watson`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project root directory.
3. Sign up for an IBM Cloud account and create an instance of the Natural Language Understanding service.
4. Obtain the API credentials (API key and service URL) for the Natural Language Understanding service.
5. Open the `app.py` file and replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` and `<YOUR_SERVICE_URL>` with your actual API credentials.
6. Save the changes to `app.py` and close the file.

## Running the Application

To run the Sentiment Analysis application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command: `python app.py`
3. The Flask server will start running and display the local address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
4. Open a web browser and enter the local address in the URL bar.
5. You should now see the Sentiment Analysis application interface.

## How to Use the Application

1. Enter the text you want to analyze in the provided input field.
2. Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the sentiment analysis process.
3. The application will send the input text to the IBM Natural Language Understanding service for sentiment analysis.
4. Once the sentiment analysis is complete, the application will display the sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral) along with a sentiment score.
5. You can repeat the process by entering new text or analyzing different inputs.

## Customization and Extension

This project can be customized and extended in various ways:

- **User Interface**: Modify the HTML and CSS templates in the `templates/` and `static/` directories to change the look and feel of the application.
- **Additional NLP Features**: The IBM Natural Language Understanding service offers various other features, such as entity extraction, keyword extraction, and emotion analysis. You can explore these features and integrate them into the application.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance the error handling mechanism to provide better user feedback in case of errors or exceptions during the sentiment analysis process.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the application to a cloud platform or hosting service to make it accessible over the internet.
